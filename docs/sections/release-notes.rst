Abstract
--------

This document provides the release notes for Istanbul release.

Summary
-------

Following DCAE components are available with default ONAP/DCAE installation.

    - Platform components

        - Cloudify Manager (helm chart)*
        - Bootstrap container (helm chart)*
        - Configuration Binding Service (helm chart)
        - Deployment Handler (helm chart)*
        - Policy Handler (helm chart*
        - Service Change Handler (helm chart)*
        - Inventory API (helm chart)*
        - Dashboard (helm chart)*
        - VES OpenAPI Manager (helm chart)

    - Service components

        - VES Collector (helm chart  & cloudify blueprint)
        - HV-VES Collector (helm chart  & cloudify blueprint)
        - PNF-Registration Handler  (helm chart  & cloudify blueprint)
        - Docker based Threshold Crossing Analytics (TCA-Gen2) (helm chart  & cloudify blueprint)

    - Additional resources that DCAE utilizes deployed using ONAP common charts:

        - Postgres Database
        - Mongo Database
        - Consul Cluster

    \*  These components will be retired next ONAP release as cloudify deployments will be diabled after Istanbul.
 

Below service components (mS) are available to be deployed on-demand (helm chart & Cloudify Blueprint)

 	- SNMPTrap Collector
 	- RESTConf Collector
 	- DataFile Collector
 	- PM-Mapper
 	- BBS-EventProcessor
 	- VES Mapper
 	- Heartbeat mS
 	- SON-Handler
 	- PM-Subscription Handler
 	- DataLake Handler (Admin and Feeder)
 	- Slice Analysis mS
 	- DataLake Extraction Service
 	- KPI-Ms


Under OOM all DCAE component containers are deployed as Kubernetes Pods/Deployments/Services into Kubernetes cluster.
With DCAE tranformation to Helm in Istanbul release - all DCAE components are available to be deployed under Helm; Cloudify blueprint deployment is provided for backward compatibility support in this release.

For Helm managed microservices, the dependencies/pre-requisite are identified on each charts individually. In general, most DCAE microservice rely on Consul/Configbindingservice for sourcing configuration updates (this dependency will be removed in next release). Each microservice can be deployed independently and based on dcaegen2-services-common template, features can be enabled or disabled via configuration override during deployment. For list of supported features in helm refer - :doc:`Using Helm to deploy DCAE Microservices <./dcaeservice_helm_template>`.

DCAE continues to provides Cloudify deployment through plugins (cloudify) that is capable of expanding a Cloudify blueprint node specification for a service component to a full Kubernetes specification, with additional enhancements such as replica scaling, sidecar for logging to ONAP ELK stack.

Known Limitations, Issues and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------

The new, Helm based installation mechanism for collectors doesn't support yet certain features available with the traditional Cloudify orchestration based mechanisms:
   - Obtaining X.509 certificates from external CMP v2 server for secure xNF connections
   - Exposing the Collector port in Dual Stack IPv4/IPv6 networks.

Such features are available, when the collectors are installed using the Cloudify mechanisms.
Refer to collector installation page for more details:

Abstract
--------

This document provides the release notes for the El-Alto Maintenance release


Summary
-------

This maintenance release is primarily to update expired certificates 
from original El-Alto released TLS-init container.

This patch is not required for Frankfurt release (and beyond) as certificates are dynamically 
retrieved from AAF at deployment time for all DCAE components.

==============

The offical El-Alto release (rolls up all 5.0.0 early drop deliverables) focused on technical debts and SECCOM priority work-items.

Following is summary of updates done for DCAEGEN2

**Security**

Following platform components were enabled for HTTPS
    - ConfigBindingService (CBS)
      -   CBS is used by all DCAE MS to fetch DCAE MS configuration from Consul. To mitigate impact for DCAE MS, CBS deployment through OOM/Helm was modified to support CBS on both HTTP and HTTPS. `Design for CBS TLS migration <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/TLS+support+for+CBS+-+Migration+Plan>`_
    - Cloudify Manager
    - InventoryAPI
    - Non-root container process (ConfigBindingService, InventoryAPI, ServiceChangeHandler, HV-VES, PRH, Son-handler)

All components interfacing with platform components were modified to support TLS interface

**Miscellaneous**
    - DCAE Dashboard deployment migration from cloudify blueprint to OOM/Chart
    - Dynamic Topic support via Dmaap plugin integration for DataFileCollector MS
    - Dynamic Topic support via Dmaap plugin integration for PM-Mapper service
    - CBS client libraries updated to remove consul service lookup
    - Image Optimization (ConfigBindingService, InventoryAPI, ServiceChangeHandler, HV-VES, PRH, Son-handler)

Version: 1.0.0
==============

:Release Date: 2017-11-16


**New Features**

DCAE is the data collection and analytics sub-system of ONAP.  Under ONAP Release 1 the DCAE
sub-system includes both platform components and DCAE service components.  Collectively the ONAP R1
DCAE components support the data collection and analytics functions for the R1 use cases, i.e. vFW,
vDNS, vCPU, and vVoLTE.

Specifically, DCAE R1 includes the following components:

- Core platform
    - Cloudify manager
    - Consul cluster
- Extended platform
    - Platform component docker host
    - Service component docker host
    - CDAP cluster
    - PostgreSQL database (*)
- Platform docker container components
    - Configuration binding service
    - Deployment handler
    - Service change handler
    - Inventory
    - Policy handler
    - CDAP broker
- Service components
    - Docker container components
        - VNF Event Streaming (VES) collector
        - Holmes (engine and rule management) **
    - CDAP analytics component
        - Threshold Crossing Analytics (TCA)

(*) Note: This component is delivered under the CCSDK project, deployed by DCAE under a single
VM configuration as a shared PostgreSQL database for the R1 demos.  (CCSDK PostgreSQL supports
other deployment configurations not used in the R1 demos.)
(**) Note: This component is delivered under the Holmes project and used as a DCAE analytics component
in R1.

Source codes of DCAE are released under the following repositories on gerrit.onap.org:

- dcaegen2
- dcaegen2/analytics
- dcaegen2/analytics/tca
- dcaegen2/collectors
- dcaegen2/collectors/snmptrap

- dcaegen2/platform/inventory-api
- dcaegen2/platform/plugins
- dcaegen2/platform/policy-handler
- dcaegen2/platform/servicechange-handler
- dcaegen2/utils


**Bug Fixes**

This is the initial release.


**Known Issues**

- Need to test/integrate into an OpenStack environment other than Intel/Windriver Pod25.
- Need to provide a dev configuration DCAE.


**Security Issues**

- The DCAE Bootstrap container needs to have a secret key for accessing VMs that it launches.  This key is currently passed in as a Heat template parameter.  Tracked by JIRA `DCAEGEN2-178 <https://jira.onap.org/browse/DCAEGEN2-178>`_.>`_.
- The RESTful API calls are generally not secure.  That is, they are either over http, or https without certificate verification.  Once there is an ONAP wide solution for handling certificates, DCAE will switch to https.


**Upgrade Notes**

This is the initial release.


**Deprecation Notes**

There is a GEN1 DCAE sub-system implementation existing in the pre-R1 ONAP Gerrit system.  The GEN1
DCAE is deprecated by the R1 release.  The DCAE included in ONAP R1 is also known as DCAE GEN2.  The
following Gerrit repos are voided and already locked as read-only.
