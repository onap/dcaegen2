**Introduction**

MOD stands for "micro-service onboarding and design" and the project is
an effort to reboot the onboarding and design experience in DCAE.

The goal of the project is to stream line the construction, management,
and evolution of DCAE flows from role to role, from environment to
environment, and from release to release.

DCAE MOD is composed of three functional areas: onboarding, design, and
distribution.

Check out the `project
wikipage <https://wiki.web.att.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1012767512>`__ that
contains information collected during requirements phase and also
contains a link to the actual high level requirements compiled by the
architects.

**Goals**

-  Provide the ability to track flows - capture and store the progress
      and evolution of flows

-  Streamline the process of constructing to deploying flows

-  Provide clear coordination and accountability

**Provide the ability to track flows**

This is a direct ECOMP ask. The solution must fit the ECOMP's release
process and must provide clear visibility along the entire process and
across different environments. The question to answer is "what needs to
go out where".

**Streamline the process of constructing to deploying flows**

How do we achieve this?

-  Solve the "merging of blueprint problem"

-  Provide auto management of DMaaP feeds/topics

-  Address all confusion about configuration - application, environment,
      system

-  Have clean hand-offs between roles

**Provide clear coordination and accountability**

How do we achieve this?

-  All participants will have roles and their responsibilities should be
      clear

-  Responsibility means ownership

-  Critical information and artifacts are collected and made accessible

-  Self serve is a must in order to scale up
