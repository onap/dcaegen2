Configuration Quick Reference
=============================

Default Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The component developer can provide default values for any ``parameter``
in the component specification. These defaults will be passed to the
component in its generated configuration.

Overridden/Entered Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the other properties set for the parameter, the default
value can be overridden at ‘design-time’, ‘deploy-time’ or once the
microservice is running (‘run-time’).
