What is Component Specification?
================================

This page will discuss categories defined in :any:`component specification schema <dcae-component-schema>` and their usage.


Meta Schema Definition
----------------------


The “Meta Schema” implementation defines how component specification
JSON schemas can be written to define user input. It is itself a JSON
schema (thus it is a “meta schema”). It requires the name of the
component entry, component type (either ‘cdap’ or ‘docker’) and a
description under “self” object. The meta schema version must be
specified as the value of the “version” key. Then the input schema
itself is described.

There are four types of schema descriptions objects - jsonschema for
inline standard JSON Schema definitions of JSON inputs, delimitedschema
for delimited data input using a JSON description defined by AT&T,
unstructured for unstructured text, and reference that allows a pointer
to another artifact for a schema. The reference allows for XML and Protocol Buffer schema,
but can be used as a pointer to JSON, Delimited Format, and Unstructured
schemas as well.

.. _component_metadata:

Component Metadata
------------------

Metadata refers to the properties found under the ``self`` JSON. This
group of properties is used to uniquely identify this component
specification and identify the component that this specification is used
to capture.

Example:

::

    "self": {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "name": "yourapp.component.kpi_anomaly",
        "description": "Classifies VNF KPI data as anomalous",
        "component_type": "docker"
    },

``self`` Schema:

.. _interfaces:

Interfaces
----------

Interfaces are the JSON objects found under the ``streams`` key and the
``services`` key. These are used to describe the interfaces that the
component uses and the interfaces that the component provides. The
description of each interface includes the associated :any:`data
format <data-formats>`.

Streams
~~~~~~~

-  The ``streams`` JSON is for specifying data produced for consumption
   by other components, and the streams expected to subscribe to that is
   produced by other components. These are “fire and forget” type
   interfaces where the publisher of a stream does not expect or parse a
   response from the subscriber.
-  The term ``stream`` here is abstract and neither refers to “CDAP
   streams” or “DMaaP feeds”. While a stream is very likely a DMaaP
   feed, it could be a direct stream of data being routed via HTTP too.
   It abstractly refers to a sequence of data leaving a publisher.
-  Streams have anonymous publish/subscribe semantics, which decouples
   the production of information from its consumption.  Like the component 
   specification, the data format specification is represented/validated against this
   `Data Format json schema <https://gerrit.onap.org/r/gitweb?p=dcaegen2/platform/cli.git;a=blob;f=component-json-schemas/data-format/dcae-cli-v1/data-format-schema.json;h=be1568291300305c7adb9a8d244d39f9e6ddadbd;hb=HEAD>`__
-  In general, components are not aware of who they are communicating
   with.
-  Instead, components that are interested in data, subscribe to the
   relevant stream; components that generate data publish to the
   relevant stream.
-  There can be multiple publishers and subscribers to a stream. Streams
   are intended for unidirectional, streaming communication.

Streams interfaces that implement an HTTP endpoint must support POST.

Streams are split into:

Subscribes
^^^^^^^^^^

Example:

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
        "subscribes": [{
            "format": "dcae.vnf.kpi",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "route": "/data",        // for CDAP this value is not used
            "type": "http"
        }],
    ...
    }

This describes that ``yourapp.component.kpi_anomaly`` exposes an HTTP
endpoint called ``/data`` which accepts requests that have the data
format of ``dcae.vnf.kpi`` version ``1.0.0``.

.. _message-router:

Message router
''''''''''''''

Message router subscribers are http clients rather than http services
and performs a http a ``GET`` call. Thus, message router subscribers
description is structured like message router publishers and requires
``config_key``:

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
        "subscribes": [{
            "format": "dcae.some-format",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "config_key": "some_format_handle",
            "type": "message router"
        }],
    ...
    }


.. _data-router:

Data router
'''''''''''

Data router subscribers are http or https services that handle ``PUT``
requests from data router. Developers must provide the ``route`` or url
path/endpoint that is expected to handle data router requests. This will
be used to construct the delivery url needed to register the subscriber
to the provisioned feed. Developers must also provide a ``config_key``
because there is dynamic configuration information associated with the
feed that the application will need e.g. username and password. See the
page on :any:`DMaaP connection objects <dmaap-data-router>` for more details on
the configuration information.

Example (not tied to the larger example):

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
        "subscribes": [{
            "config_key": "some-sub-dr",
            "format": "sandbox.platform.any",
            "route": "/identity",
            "type": "data_router",
            "version": "0.1.0"
        }],
    ...
    }

.. _kafka:

Kafka
''''''''''''''

Kafka subscribers are clients fetching data directly from kafka.

``config_key``:

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
        "subscribes": [{
            "format": "dcae.some-format",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "config_key": "some_format_handle",
            "type": "kafka"
        }],
    ...
    }

Publishes
^^^^^^^^^

Example:

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
    ...
        "publishes": [{
            "format": "yourapp.format.integerClassification",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "config_key": "prediction",
            "type": "http"
        }]
    },

This describes that ``yourapp.component.kpi_anomaly`` publishes by making
POST requests to streams that support the data format
``yourapp.format.integerClassification`` version ``1.0.0``.

.. message-router-1:

Message router
''''''''''''''

Message router publishers are http clients of DMaap message_router.
Developers must provide a ``config_key`` because there is dynamic
configuration information associated with the feed that the application
needs to receive e.g. topic url, username, password. See the page on
:any:`DMaaP connection objects <dmaap-message-router>` for more details on
the configuration information.

Example (not tied to the larger example):

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
    ...
        "publishes": [{
            "config_key": "some-pub-mr",
            "format": "sandbox.platform.any",
            "type": "message_router",
            "version": "0.1.0"
        }]
    }

.. data-router-1:

Data router
'''''''''''

Data router publishers are http clients that make ``PUT`` requests to
data router. Developers must also provide a ``config_key`` because there
is dynamic configuration information associated with the feed that the
application will need to receive e.g. publish url, username, password.
See the page on :any:`DMaaP connection objects <dmaap-data-router>` for more details on
the configuration information.

Example (not tied to the larger example):

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
    ...
        "publishes": [{
            "config_key": "some-pub-dr",
            "format": "sandbox.platform.any",
            "type": "data_router",
            "version": "0.1.0"
        }]
    }

.. kafka-1:

Kafka
''''''''''''''

Kafka publishers are clients publishing data directly to kafka.

``config_key``:

.. code:: json

    "streams": {
        "publishes": [{
            "format": "dcae.some-format",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "config_key": "some_format_handle",
            "type": "kafka"
        }],
    ...
    }

Quick Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Refer to this :doc:`Quick Reference <streams-grid>` for a
comparison of the Streams ‘Publishes’ and ‘Subscribes’ sections.

Services
~~~~~~~~

-  The publish / subscribe model is a very flexible communication
   paradigm, but its many-to-many one-way transport is not appropriate
   for RPC request / reply interactions, which are often required in a
   distributed system.
-  Request / reply is done via a Service, which is defined by a pair of
   messages: one for the request and one for the reply.

Services are split into:

Calls
^^^^^

The JSON ``services/calls`` is for specifying that the component relies
on an HTTP(S) service—the component sends that service an HTTP request,
and that service responds with an HTTP reply. An example of this is how
string matching (SM) depends on the AAI Broker. SM performs a
synchronous REST call to the AAI broker, providing it the VMNAME of the
VNF, and the AAI Broker responds with additional details about the VNF.
This dependency is expressed via ``services/calls``. In contrast, the
output of string matching (the alerts it computes) is sent directly to
policy as a fire-and-forget interface, so that is an example of a
``stream``.

Example:

.. code:: json

    "services": {
        "calls": [{
            "config_key": "vnf-db",
            "request": {
                "format": "dcae.vnf.meta",
                "version": "1.0.0"
                },
            "response": {
                "format": "dcae.vnf.kpi",
                "version": "1.0.0"
                }
        }],
    ...
    }

This describes that ``yourapp.component.kpi_anomaly`` will make HTTP
calls to a downstream component that accepts requests of data format
``dcae.vnf.meta`` version ``1.0.0`` and is expecting the response to be
``dcae.vnf.kpi`` version ``1.0.0``.

Provides
^^^^^^^^

Example:

.. code:: json

    "services": {
    ...
        "provides": [{
            "route": "/score-vnf",
            "request": {
                "format": "dcae.vnf.meta",
                "version": "1.0.0"
                },
            "response": {
                "format": "yourapp.format.integerClassification",
                "version": "1.0.0"
                }
        }]
    },

This describes that ``yourapp.component.kpi_anomaly`` provides a service
interface and it is exposed on the ``/score-vnf`` HTTP endpoint. The
endpoint accepts requests that have the data format ``dcae.vnf.meta``
version ``1.0.0`` and gives back a response of
``yourapp.format.integerClassification`` version ``1.0.0``.

Many of the parameter properties have been copied from TOSCA model
property definitions and are to be used for service design composition
and policy creation. See `section 3.5.8 *Property
definition* <http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.html>`__.

Health check
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Component developers are required to provide a way for the platform to
periodically check the health of their running components. The
details of the definition used by your component is to be provided
through the :any:`Docker auxiliary specification <docker-auxiliary-details>`.

The information contained in the auxilary_docker field is the Docker component specification schema. Some properties of the docker component specification include -

healthcheck : Defines the health check that Consul should perform for this component

log_info : Component specific details for logging, includes the path in the container where logs are written that can also be used for logstash/kibana style reporting.

ports : Port mapping to be used for Docker containers. Each entry is of the format <container port>:<host port>.

tls_info : Component information for use of tls certificates, where they will be available, whether or not to use them

policy : Information for Policy configuration and reconfiguration

databases: Information about databases the application should connect to

volumes: Contains information on volume mapping for the docker containers
