Flow for converting RestConf Collector notification
===================================================
[1] RestConf Collector generates rcc-notication in JSON format and publishes it on DMaaP topic **unathenticated.DCAE_RCC_OUTPUT**
[2] The Universal VES Adapter(UVA) microservice has subscribed to this DMaaP topic.
[3] On receiving an event from DMaaP, the adapter uses the corresponding mapping file and converts received notification into the VES event. It uses the notification-id from the received notification to find the required mapping file. 
[4] Those notifications for which no mapping file is identified, a default mapping file is used with generic mappings to create the VES event.
[5] The VES formatted Event will be then published on DMaaP topic **unauthenticated.VES_PNFREG_OUTPUT**.
