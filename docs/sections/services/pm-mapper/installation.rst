PM mapper is a microservice that will be instantiated by Cloudify Manager. PM Mapper blueprint is uploaded into Cloudify Manager where that user can configure the PM Mapper.
Cloudify Manager will then proceed to instantiate the pm mapper service within DCAE Services. During instantiation, the PM mapper will query configuration information using the Config Binding Service.
