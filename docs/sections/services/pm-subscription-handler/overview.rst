Overview
========

Introduction
""""""""""""
The PM Subscription Handler (PMSH) is a micro service written in Python, which allows for the definition and activation
of PM subscriptions on one or more network function (NF) instances.

.. _Delivery: ./delivery.html

Functionality
"""""""""""""
The PMSH allows for the definition of subscriptions on a network level, which enables the configuration of PM data on a
set of NF instances. During configuration of the PMSH, subscriptions as well as a ``nfFilter`` can be defined. This
filter will then be used to produce a subset of NF's to which the subscription will be applied. If an NF which matches
the filter is registered in ONAP after the microservice has been deployed, the subscription will be applied to that NF
also.

Interaction
"""""""""""

Config Binding Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PMSH interacts with the Config Binding Service to retrieve it's configuration information, including the
subscription information.

DMaaP
^^^^^

The PMSH subscribes and publishes to various DMaaP Message Router topics (See :ref:`Topics<Topics>`
for more information on which topics are used).

A&AI
^^^^

The PMSH interacts with A&AI to fetch data about network functions. The ``nfFilter`` is then
applied to this data to produce a targeted subset of NF's.

Policy and CDS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PMSH will indirectly interact with Policy and CDS in order to push subscriptions to NF's. A policy will be used to
make a request to CDS, which will apply the subscription to the NF.
