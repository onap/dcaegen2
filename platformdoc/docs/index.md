## Background

DCAE is composed of a platform and services.  The DCAE platform is all of the technical pieces responsible for the deployment and the management of DCAE services.  The DCAE services are the components responsible for monitoring network services, and data collection and analytics.

Currently, the current DCAE Platform is a hybrid running both the 'classic (or old) controller' and what's commonly called the 'new controller'. 

### For 1710

The classic controller is deploying and managing all CDAP applications, and docker applications that were deployed prior to 1710.
All other docker applications are being deployed and managed by the new controller.

### For 1802

The classic controller is deploying and managing all CDAP applications, and some docker applications that were deployed prior to 1710.
Some docker applications are being migrated from the classic to the new controller. All new docker applications are being deployed and managed by the new controller.
