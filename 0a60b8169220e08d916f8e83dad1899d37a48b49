      "message": "I think, we need a generic, short description on how we do manage the VES collector configuration using Helm charts. Something along the lines of:\n1. Starting from ONAP/Istanbul VES Collector deployment is happening with a Helm chart\n2. DCAEGEN2-Services (check...) is the Helm chart, which need to be updated\n3. All VES collector updates are happening thru (and provide here the example of a property change) -- like this: helm -n onap upgrade dev-dcaegen2-services --values \u003cpath to values\u003e\n4. The default VES collector values.yaml file is located at \u003cLink to git repo, where the latest VES/values.yaml is located).\n5. We can add, that the VES Collector application properties are stored in the dcae-ves-collector section of values.yaml file?",

      "message": "Hey Vijay -- well I was thinking, if it shall be here in DCAE, not necessarily in OOM.\nBasically our starting point was - we have an ONAP system deployed, and we`d like to introduce some modifications. That is why we have here \"helm update \u003crelease\u003e\" and not helm install \u003crelease\u003e.\n\nThen You`re correct - each MS shall probably refer to this general description, and then continue with MS-specific properties.\n\nOn the patch submission -- I think, we can focus on the changes related to the configMap (externalRepo) - and You can describe the overall DCAE Application (re)configuration aspect, and then we link these pages together. Makes sense?",
